# LeetCode Daily Practice 📝

This repository is dedicated to my **daily LeetCode practice**.  
I solve problems every day to improve my skills in **Data Structures, Algorithms, and Problem Solving**.

## 📌 Purpose
- Build strong problem-solving skills  
- Improve coding efficiency and logic  
- Prepare for coding interviews  

## 🚀 Progress
I aim to solve **at least one problem daily** and push the solutions here.  

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools
- **Java** (primary language)  
- May include other languages for practice  

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each file is named according to the **LeetCode problem number/title** for easy reference.  


## ✅ Commitment
Consistency is the key.  
This repo will serve as my coding log and help me track my growth over time.
